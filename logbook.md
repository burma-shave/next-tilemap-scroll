Sample project works. Might need to initialise the palette after all.

Not working. Trying sample files from ZX next assembly developer guide sample.
8bit tilemap instead of 16bit tilemap. Still not working. Maybe need to
initialise palette. Assumed default palette would work, but worth a try.
Should also try cloning sample project and see if that works.

---

Load tilemap data.

Create new map for 40x32 initially just to test.

Create 40xXX row major order map to test vertical scroll

Create XXxXX to try XY scrolling.
